# Contributing to Kumiho ComfyUI Nodes

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Kumiho ComfyUI Nodes! 🦊

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- ComfyUI installed (manual installation recommended for development)
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kumiho-comfyui.git
   cd kumiho-comfyui
   ```

2. **Create a symlink in your ComfyUI custom_nodes folder**
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
   New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "C:\path\to\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\kumiho-comfyui" -Target "C:\path\to\kumiho-comfyui"
   
   # Linux/macOS
   ln -s /path/to/kumiho-comfyui /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/kumiho-comfyui
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pytest black isort mypy
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Node

1. Create your node class in `kumiho_nodes/nodes.py` or a new file under `kumiho_nodes/`
2. Follow the ComfyUI node structure:
   ```python
   class MyNewNode:
       CATEGORY = "Kumiho/Category"
       
       @classmethod
       def INPUT_TYPES(cls):
           return {"required": {...}, "optional": {...}}
       
       RETURN_TYPES = (...)
       RETURN_NAMES = (...)
       FUNCTION = "my_function"
       
       def my_function(self, ...):
           # Implementation
           return (result,)
   ```
3. Register your node in `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` and `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`
4. Test thoroughly in ComfyUI

### Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

```bash
# Format code
black kumiho_nodes/
isort kumiho_nodes/

# Type check
mypy kumiho_nodes/
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=kumiho_nodes
```
